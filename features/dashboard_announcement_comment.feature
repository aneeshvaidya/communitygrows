Feature: successfully comment on an announcement on the main dashboard
  
  As a user

  So that the conversation between different users can be established

Background: user is on the main dashboard page and announcement is made
  
  Given the following announcements exist:
    | title      | content          | created_at           | committee_type   |
    | aaaaaaa    | announceone      | 2016-03-17 17:44:13  | dashboard        |
